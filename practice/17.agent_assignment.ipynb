      "Summary: In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux utility xz within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name \"Jia Tan\". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\n",

      "Page: XZ Utils\n",
      "Summary: XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",

      "Page: Backdoor (computing)\n",
      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mOn March 28, 2024 a backdoor was identified in XZ Utils. This vulnerability, CVE-2024-3094 with a CVSS score of 10 is a result of a software supply chain compromise impacting versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has recommended organizations to downgrade to a previous non-compromised XZ Utils version. Description . Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of xz, starting with version 5.6.0. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the liblzma build process extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific functions in the liblzma code. Interests outside of work: Scott enjoys spending time with his family, camping, fishing and being outdoors. He also enjoys finding ways to break web applications and home renovation projects. Frequently asked questions about CVE-2024-3094, a supply-chain attack responsible for a backdoor in XZ Utils, a widely used library found in multiple ... How to remediate CVE-2024-3094. Immediately downgrade your version of xz to an earlier version (5.4.6 is the latest unaffected version in most distributions). After downgrading xz, either reboot your machine or restart the OpenSSH server in order to remove the patched code from memory -. sudo systemctl restart ssh. On March 28, 2024, a backdoor was identified in the popular xz-utils package and reported to the oss-security@openwall mailing list one day later, on March 29. It was assigned CVE-2024-3094 and affects versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1. When infecting a system, the backdoor would change the behavior of the sshd binary and allow an attacker with ...\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",

The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.\n",
      "While xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems, but was present in development versions of major distributions. The backdoor was discovered by the software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on 29 March 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: XZ Utils\n",
      "Summary: XZ Utils (previously LZMA Utils) is a set of free software command-line lossless data compressors, including the programs lzma and xz, for Unix-like operating systems and, from version 5.0 onwards, Microsoft Windows. For compression/decompression the Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm (LZMA) is used. XZ Utils started as a Unix port of Igor Pavlov's LZMA-SDK that has been adapted to fit seamlessly into Unix environments and their usual structure and behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Backdoor (computing)\n",
      "Summary: A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device (e.g. a home router), or its embodiment (e.g. part of a cryptosystem, algorithm, chipset, or even a \"homunculus computer\"—a tiny computer-within-a-computer such as that found in Intel's AMT technology). Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptosystems. From there it may be used to gain access to privileged information like passwords, corrupt or delete data on hard drives, or transfer information within autoschediastic networks.\n",
      "A backdoor may take the form of a hidden part of a program, a separate program (e.g. Back Orifice may subvert the system through a rootkit), code in the firmware of the hardware, or parts of an operating system such as Windows. Trojan horses can be used to create vulnerabilities in a device. A Trojan horse may appear to be an entirely legitimate program, but when executed, it triggers an activity that may install a backdoor. Although some are secretly installed, other backdoors are deliberate and widely known. These kinds of backdoors have \"legitimate\" uses such as providing the manufacturer with a way to restore user passwords.\n",
      "Many systems that store information within the cloud fail to create accurate security measures. If many systems are connected within the cloud, hackers can gain access to all other platforms through the most vulnerable system. Default passwords (or other default credentials) can function as backdoors if they are not changed by the user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if they are not removed in the release version. In 1993, the United States government attempted to deploy an encryption system, the Clipper chip, with an explicit backdoor for law enforcement and national security access. The chip was unsuccessful.\n",
      "Recent proposals to counter backdoors include creating a database of backdoors' triggers and then using neural networks to detect them.\n",

      "\u001b[0m\u001b[33;1m\u001b[1;3mWhat Does the Backdoor Do? Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote ... That operation matches the style of the XZ Utils backdoor far more than the cruder supply chain attacks of APT41 or Lazarus, by comparison. \"It could very well be someone else,\" says Aitel. The back door part comes into play with one of the main ways xz is used - SSH. SSH is an encrypted protocol between two machines where text commands can be exchanged, allowing a user to interact with a server. It's a very common utility in the Linux world and the security of this communication is critical. A malicious developer inserted a complex backdoor into the open-source library XZ Utils, which affects many Linux distributions and enables remote code execution. Learn how the backdoor works, how to identify it, and what actions to take to protect your systems. A malicious backdoor was found in a compression tool that made its way into widely used Linux distributions, including Red Hat and Debian. The backdoor, introduced by a developer named JiaT75, interferes with SSH authentication and allows unauthorized access to the system.\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",
